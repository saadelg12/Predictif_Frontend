# Predictif_Frontend
Frontend of the Predict'IF App

Front-End Application for Predictive Services
This project provides a front-end interface for a predictive services application, featuring an intuitive design for user interactions. The main functionalities allow users to register, log in, and navigate through various predictive features such as viewing astrological profiles, consulting mediums, and browsing client profiles.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Registration and login forms are available for both clients and employees.
Predictive Profiles: Users can view and interact with astrological profiles, view medium details, and browse consultations.
User-Friendly Interface: HTML and CSS files designed for ease of navigation, with images and styles optimized for readability and visual appeal.
Technical Details:

Languages: HTML and CSS for the user interface.
Organization: Front-end files are located within predictif/src/main/webapp/, with components for each major interface feature (e.g., registration, login, profile viewing).
Note: The backend, which manages user data, predictions, and consultations, is not authored by me and therefore not provided. It handles the data processing and logic for the predictive services and is designed to interact seamlessly with this front-end.
